# Advent of Code Solutions

Solutions for Advent of Code organized by year and language.  Starting with C#.

### C#
Each year has it's own Visual Studio solution files (.slnx), with each day being it's own project.

## Structure
- cs – C# (.NET)
- py – Python (future)
- js – JavaScript (future)

## How to Run
Input files should be named input.txt and reside in the same folder as the source

### C# (.NET 10 allows running from the CLI, like a script)
dotnet run 2025/cs/day01/Program.cs

### Python 
python 2025/py/day01/day01.py

### JavaScript
